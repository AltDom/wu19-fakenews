# FakeNews

<img src="http://gph.is/1rqkFj1" width="100%">

This is the first assignment I did which combines PHP, HTML and CSS. It is a news feed consisting of 10 fake articles. The news feed randomly assigns an author (name & picture), published date, and the number of likes & dislikes to each article with every reload of the browser. All of the possible authors (except one) are students who studied with me in the WebUtvecklare19 course at YRGO, Lindholmen.
