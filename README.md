# Fake News Feed

This is the first assignment I did which combines PHP, HTML and CSS. It is a news feed consisting of 10 fake articles. The news feed randomly assigns an author (name & picture) and published date, as well as the number of likes & dislikes to each article with every reload of the browser. All of the authors who pop up in the feed (except one!) are students who studied with me in the Webbutvecklare course at YRGO, Lindholmen in 2019.
